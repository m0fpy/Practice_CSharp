The C++ Memory Layout feature provides you with the ability to visualize and explore the memory layout of your C++ classes, structs, and unions. This feature offers insight into the memory organization of your data types.

With this feature, you can view the padding, offsets, and sizes of all the data members contained within your types.

When you hover your cursor over the name of a class, struct, or union, a "Memory Layout" link appears in the tooltip. Clicking the link opens a window that provides an interactive visualization of your type's memory organization. Within the memory layout window, you can hover over individual data members to reveal their specific offsets and sizes.
To view the memory layout in a tabular format, click on the ‘Table’ icon within the memory layout window. This will instantly transform the current view into a well-organized table.

Please share your overall impressions, how we can improve it, and any additional feedback you may have on this experience via [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/VisualStudio).
