Spend less time debugging and more time building great apps.

Live Property Explorer, a powerful tool that enables more efficient development, is now supported with .NET MAUI. It allows you to easily view and tweak the properties of your app controls at runtime, which is especially useful when you're looking to debug issues, optimize performance, or investigate where a property is defined in XAML. 

To access the Live Property Explorer: Start and debug your app. Then, navigate to **Debug** > **Windows** > **Live Property Explorer**.

Once you've opened the Live Property Explorer, you can use it to explore and live edit properties in your .NET MAUI app. For more information, see the demo video below or visit [Inspect XAML properties while debugging](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/xaml-tools/inspect-xaml-properties-while-debugging).
