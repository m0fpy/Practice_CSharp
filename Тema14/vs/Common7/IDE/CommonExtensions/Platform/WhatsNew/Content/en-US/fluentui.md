title: Try out the all new Visual Studio UI

---

The Visual Studio UI Refresh that we teased back in May is finally available to try out. This preview brings a new UI for Visual Studio built around three primary pillars: cohesiveness, accessibility and productivity.
- The new UI is aligned with the Microsoft Fluent design language that is used across many other Microsoft products, including Microsoft 365 and now Visual Studio will deliver a more cohesive experience with other Microsoft products.
- Visual Studio's UI increases control size to help folks with motor disabilities and using color more intentionally to reduce visual clutter while still maintaining information density.
- Improved consistency reduces cognitive load and productivity.

To enable the UI Refresh, turn on "Experimental control styles" under the Preview Features, then restart Visual Studio.
 
The Blue theme is currently unavailable. If you enable the UI refresh and have the Blue theme selected, Visual Studio will apply the "Cool Breeze" theme once you restart.
 
We want to hear your feedback on the new experience. [Tell us what you think!](https://aka.ms/uirefresh179devcomm)
