title: Let GitHub Copilot generate your Git Commit messages

---

GitHub Copilot can generate a summary of your Git Changes to help you write better Git commit messages.

To try it out, you'll need an active [GitHub Copilot subscription](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=vscom&utm_medium=hero&utm_campaign=cta-get#pricing) and the [preview GitHub Copilot Chat Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.VSGitHubCopilot). Click on the "Add AI Generated Commit Message" sparkle pen icon in the Git Changes window to generate a suggestion. Copilot will look at the file changes in your commit, summarize them, and then describe each change. You can then "Insert AI Suggestion" or "Discard."
