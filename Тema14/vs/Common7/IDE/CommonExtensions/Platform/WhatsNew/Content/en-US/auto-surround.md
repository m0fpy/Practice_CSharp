You can now easily surround a selection with bracket delimiters including: "double quotes", 'single quotes', and (parentheses).

You can enable or disable auto surround by going to **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor** and checking the **"Automatically surround selections when typing quotes or brackets"** option.
