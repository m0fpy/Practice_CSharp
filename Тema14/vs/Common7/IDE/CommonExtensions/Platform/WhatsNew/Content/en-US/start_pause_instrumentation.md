The Instrumentation tool now supports the 'start-pause' option in application profiling. This feature allows temporarily pausing data collection, letting you start the application under the profiler's control without immediately collecting data.
When you're ready, simply hit the record button to begin data collection. This functionality is especially useful in scenarios like gaming, where users want to dive into gameplay and set up for issue reproduction before data collection starts. 

The feature works seamlessly with both native and managed projects.
