title: Easily verify extension owners

---

With our modernized Extension Manager (currently available as a preview feature), you can easily determine whether publishers have verified ownership of the domains associated with their extensions. When browsing for extensions in the Visual Studio Marketplace, a check mark icon next to the domain on the extension details pane indicates that the publisher is the verified owner of that domain.

Verified domain support is available with our new Extension Manager, which you can try out by enabling the preview feature called "Extension Manager UI Refresh" via **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Preview Features**. The new Extension Manager features rich, detailed extension descriptions to help you find extensions that boost your productivity and help you make Visual Studio your own!

If you have any feedback or suggestions about how to improve the Extension Manager, please share them with us on [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Modern-Extension-Manager-for-Visual-Stud/10401804)
