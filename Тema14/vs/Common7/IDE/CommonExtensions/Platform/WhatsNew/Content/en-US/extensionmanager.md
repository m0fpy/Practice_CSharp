title: Try out the new Extension Manager

---

We've redesigned the Extension Manager to make it more modern, easier for you to find great extensions from the Visual Studio Marketplace, and improve managing your existing extensions. Since its initial release for the Preview version of Visual Studio, we've continued to refine and improve our new design based on your feedback! 

The refreshed UI displays extension descriptions for each extension as you select them instead of requiring you to navigate to the Visual Studio Marketplace on the web for more details. You'll now be able to learn more about extensions without ever leaving Visual Studio.

Try out the new Extension Manager by enabling the preview feature called "Extension Manager UI Refresh" via **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Preview Features**.
